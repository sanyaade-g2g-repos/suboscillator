## This is a Music Project ##
The goal is to collaborate with musicians and produce some cool tunes.

## The Method ##
The initial vision is this: users join the project, then contribute samples, MIDI, etc. People can download those samples and produce partial or complete works from them and re-commit these works to the project for others to remix, master, or otherwise manipulate. Completed works could be rated by participants and top rated works will be put on the project's [MySpace Page](http://www.myspace.com/suboscillator) and distributed freely elsewhere.

## The Rules ##
The rules are simple: No commercial samples. Any sound added to this project must be freely redistributable. We will ask things like "Which plugins were used, what samples were used", etc. to promote openness and accessibility. Also please read the [Terms of Service](http://code.google.com/tos.html) for Google Code.

## The Repository ##
The heart of the Suboscillator project is the Subversion Repository which can contain up to 100mb of files. These will be audio fragments, songs, midi files, etc. which participants of this project can use to create music. It is important when modifying the repository that all changes are noted with an explanation, and that files are named and organized logically. All files added to the repository are public domain; no commercial or copyrighted material will be included.

### Instruments ###
The Instruments folder is to contain small samples that are not arranged. These should be less than 1mb each and must be .wav format.

### Riffs ###
The Riffs folder will contain loopable samples organized in folders by tempo. (in BPM) These files should not exceed 2-3mb in size each and must be .wav format.

### MIDI files ###
MIDI files can be performances, sequences, etc. Please label them logically and create folders to keep related MIDI files together.

### Songs ###
The Songs folder is for partial or complete songs in .ogg format. The .ogg format is like .mp3, a lossy format. However .ogg requires no proprietary codecs to create or play back which makes them perfect for this project. The songs you add to this project are for examples of finished or partial works to convey ideas, etc.

## Larger Files, Host Data, etc. ##
It would be hypocritical to discourage the exchange of source files, archives, and such. If you produce a finished work that you wish to have mastered or remixed by another project member please share that data outside the repository for now. If the need arises for more hosting space it can be addressed when the time comes. Such needs should be addressed using the "Issues" section of this page.

## Maintaining the Suboscillator Project ##
The owners of this project will perform maintenance tasks to keep things organized and tidy. This includes removing duplicate files, excessively large files, or anything which could infringe on intellectual property rights of anyone else. The owners of this project expect that participants in the project will do the same. Think of the repository as a practice space and the files within are instruments, cables, and microphones belonging to another band. When the other band comes to the practice space they expect to find their instruments and such in place and intact.

## Limitations ##
Obviously we're limited by space. We get 100MB to store information which means there will be a limit to the number of simultaneous songs that can be worked on. Also that means that very long high quality samples won't fit. I think that we can use that space constraint as a way to keep things simple.

## How to Participate ##

  1. Create a folder on your 'puter called 'Suboscillator'
  1. Get a SVN Client program to 'checkout' the files from this site
  1. Make some music with your favorite tracker.
    * Sample the stuff in the 'Suboscillator' folder
    * Add Samples to the 'Suboscillator' folder (in .wav format)
  1. Commit your changes to this page using your SVN Client program

### Otherwise ###
