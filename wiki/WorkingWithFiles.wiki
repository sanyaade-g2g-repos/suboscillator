#This page will explain how to access and update the Suboscillator Project's files. It is a work in progress and needs expansion.

= Introduction =
The files associated with this project are maintained using a Subversion repository. You can synchronize the files on this site with files on your computer using a Subversion client such as Tortoise on Windows and RapidSVN on Linux. 

== Restrictions ==
Please adhere to the following:
  * Submit only .mid .wav or .txt files
  * Keep sizes small.
    * 1mb or less for instruments
    * 5mb or less for riffs
  * Only submit stuff you own exclusive rights to.
  * Agree to license your work freely under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html GPLv2]

== Getting the Files ==
Start by getting an SVN client and getting familiar with how it works. You will typically need to import or connect to this site using the parameters under the "Source" tab. Once you establish a local working copy, you can go about mixing up samples, adding new sounds, or whatever you wish.

== Adding your Files == 
If you've created something new and you wish to add it to the site for others to use, then you need to 'commit' these changes. Steps will vary slightly depending on which client program you use but typically it works something like this:

  # Syncronize files to a "working directory" on your computer
  # Manipulate the files & folders in the working directory as needed
  # "Add" the files to the working folder using your client program
  # "Commit" the changes when finished.

This will result in the files being added for others to work with.
